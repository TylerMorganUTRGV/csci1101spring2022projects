9734,1127,Castlevania: Bloodlines,"In 1897, the long war between humanity and Dracula came to an end, as Dracula was laid to eternal rest by Quincey Morris, a distant descendant of the Belmont family. Peace was restored to Europe, until the outbreak of the First World War, which transformed the continent into a dark world filled with massacre and violence. At the beginning of the war, in June 1914 at Sarajevo, the Crown Prince of Austria was assassinated. It was said that a strange beautiful woman was involved, within the shadows. It was Elizabeth Bartley. In order to revive her uncle, Count Dracula, she conducted an unholy ceremony which caused the war, giving her possession of human souls from Europe.  The game itself takes place in 1917. The characters are John Morris, a distant descendant of the famed Belmont and Morris families who obeyed his fate to fight vampires day and night, and Eric Lecarde, whose girlfriend was transformed into a vampire when Elizabeth was revived. After Drolta Tzuentes resurrected Elizabeth Bartley, they traveled across Europe to conduct the resurrection of Count Dracula. John Morris and Eric Lecarde followed them. Even though the resurrection of Dracula was a success, the vampire hunters defeated him, and his allies.",1994-03-17 00:00:00.000,14,NULL,NULL,NULL,74.5109,68

13594,183870,Genpei Kassen,"Similar to other Koei historical simulations, the player begins their game by first selecting a scenario. Scenarios include:  1. Yoritomo Lays the Foundations of Kamakura (October 1180): Kiyomori's conquests, Yoritomo's exile and rise within the Hōjō 2. Yoshinaka Seizes The Capital (July 1183): Yoshinaka's insurgent forces collide with Yoritomo, Munemori's succession of the Heike 3. Heike Restoration at the Western Sea (October 1184): Situation of the war after the Battle of Ichi-no-tani, Heike have lost property and start stranded within the west 4. Yoshitsune Slays His Brother's Adversaries (October 1185): Battle of Dan-no-ura, contention between Yoritomo and Yoshitsune in Oshu  The Heike are powerful in the first two story paths, but the Genji will have the clear advantage for the other half. The Fujiwara clan remain resourceful yet ambivalent in every scenario. Like early Nobunaga's Ambition or Romance of the Three Kingdoms, animations and duels can be turned off. Historical events are automatically triggered based on the game's date, yet the player can actively prevent them from occurring. Killing Yoritomo before Kiyomori succumbs to illness, for instance, will never trigger Kiyomori's historical death in the first story path.  The time spent in each scenario is limitless, only ending once the player has either lost or claimed victory. At any time, the player may choose to leave their side's actions to the game's AI.",1994-12-31 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Johnathan tests a new space walking suit, but is drifted away into space by accident and is presumed dead by his colleagues. He is found alive and well 25 years later thanks to the cold-sleep module connected to the suit. Three years later, Jonathan (now a private investigator working in the former Los Angeles) is visited by his former wife, Lorraine who asks for Jonathan's help in solving the disappearance of her current husband, Kenzo Hojo, the only clues he left behind being a torn leaf, a set of capsules, and the word ""Plato"". Jonathan is reluctant to take her case at first, but after Lorraine leaves his office, she is attacked and murdered by a man in a black motorcycle suit. Jonathan, unable to catch the culprit, decides to fulfill his ex-wife's final request and travels to Beyond, where he is reunited with his former partner from his LAPD days, Ed Brown who agrees to help Jonathan investigate the circumstances surrounding Hojo's disappearance and Lorraine's murder.  During the course of the investigation, Jonathan and Ed learn that Becker and Tokugawa have been involved in running an illegal drug and organ trafficking ring in order to counteract the negative side-effects of being in space for long periods of time. Hojo had been included in the business in order to save his daughter, Karen, and ultimately wanted to leave, only to be murdered. During a stand-off with Becker, Jonathan records Becker's confession about the scheme and has Meryl broadcast the recording live, exposing the scandal to the colonists. Ed saves Jonathan from death, while Meryl and the remaining police arrest Tokugawa. Jonathan donates his bone marrow to Karen upon learning that he is her biological father, and returns to Earth.",1994-07-29 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,83.3953,7

57030,22349,RayForce,"In the distant future, human governments, across the planet Earth, construct a massive supercomputer, named ""Con-Human"". The purpose of this computer is to govern the planet's environmental systems, verifying proper nutrients and care is provided to ensure the culture of humans and animal alike.  However, disaster strikes when, after a cloned human's mind is linked with the system, Con-Human becomes sentient and insane. It begins to induce calamities across the planet, constructing corrupt clones of existing organisms, destroying its human masters and exterminating the nature it was intended to protect, apparently intending to replace everything with what Con-Human considers improved versions of themselves.  After prolonged war, Con-Human has succeeded in exterminating 99.8% of humankind, with the remnants fleeing to space colonies. Meanwhile, Con-Human remakes the very interior of Earth. As a result, Earth, as humanity knew it, has utterly ceased to exist, transformed into a planet-sized mobile fortress that is in fact Con-Human's body. Con-Human intends to use the transformed Earth to seek out and destroy the colonies, erasing all remaining traces of old life from the universe and leaving only the new life that it personally created. Now, taking the full-scale offensive, mankind develops powerful ships, one of them the RVA-818 X-LAY starfighter, to fight the oppressive machine by destroying the now-infected Earth entirely.",1994-12-31 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

57480,11219,Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles,"At the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, the evil Dr. Robotnik had his Death Egg downed from orbit by the heroes, Sonic the Hedgehog and his companion Miles ""Tails"" Prower. Having not been completely destroyed after all, the Death Egg has crash-landed on the Floating Island, taking it to the ocean below. This island has special properties - not least of which being its eponymous power of magical suspension. When Dr. Robotnik detects the presence of a massive Chaos Emerald within the island's depths, he decides to once again seek out the Chaos Emeralds so that his fallen Death Egg can regain orbit in space. Turning his crushing defeat into a sleek advantage yet again, he kidnaps Animals to convert into Badniks and created a new line of weapons.  Meanwhile, Knuckles is taking his usual walk along the Emerald altar to check if the Emeralds are alright, suddenly a huge earthquake came out of nowhere, Knuckles saw the Emeralds reverberating in mid-air, stunned, he was suddenly threw into the air before blacking out. When he woke up, the Chaos Emeralds were gone, but Knuckles also saw a huge egg in the distance, surprised, he then recalled a legend of an ancient dragon sent to destroy the world in the end times, thinking this mysterious egg to be the dragon he set out, and... A giant egg-shaped figure appeared out of nowhere, calling himself ""Dr. Eggman"", he explained to Knuckles he had come here to study this giant egg, and that an evil hedgehog named Sonic was trying to not only interfere with his research, but steal the Chaos Emeralds as well. Knuckles, duped by the doctor, ran off to find this miscreant. Eggman smiled at himself, pleased at his ability to lie.  Immediately after the event of Sonic 3 where Dr. Robotnik's orbital weapon, the Death Egg, is damaged in a battle with Sonic and crash-lands back onto Angel Island. Sonic travels through each zone looking to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds to defeat Robotnik, and once again comes into conflict with Knuckles, who believes Sonic is trying to steal the Emeralds for himself. In Hidden Palace Zone, Sonic fights and defeats Knuckles. The two hear a disturbance outside of the chamber, and go out to find Dr. Robotnik stealing the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. Knuckles attempts to attack Robotnik, but is electrically shocked in the process, and is trapped with Sonic in an underground passage. Knuckles, realizing Sonic is on his side, shows him a portal that leads them to Sky Sanctuary, where the Death Egg is relaunching. Sonic proceeds to infiltrate the Death Egg, and defeats Robotnik as Super Sonic.  Knuckles' story, which takes place after the events of Sonic's campaign, begins in Mushroom Hill,[b] where he is relaxing with his animal friends but is interrupted by a bomb dropped by EggRobo. This prompts Knuckles to chase after him, leading him through more difficult versions of most of the same zones Sonic went through. The chase ends at the damaged remains of Sky Sanctuary, where a robot called Mecha Sonic attacks Knuckles but accidentally destroys EggRobo instead. After a short fight, Mecha Sonic uses the power of the Master Emerald to achieve a Super form similar to Sonic's. Knuckles manages to defeat Super Mecha Sonic, who explodes. Sonic flies in piloting the biplane Tornado and Knuckles hitches a ride to return the Master Emerald to Angel Island. If all the Chaos Emeralds are collected, Angel Island rises upwards, into the sky. However, if the player has not collected all the Chaos Emeralds, Knuckles cannot redeem the Master Emerald, and Angel Island plummets into the ocean.",1994-10-18 00:00:00.000,36,NULL,NULL,NULL,89.6313,91

58955,129405,Escape from Ragor: Megrim's Rache,"Escape from Ragor is a german fantasy role playing game, a typical dungeon crawler with tile-based movement and real-time combat. You're thrown into the labyrinthine dungeons of Castle Ragor and must now get out, overcoming the traps and obstacles set by its nefarious master, Megrim. Explore the walls of Ragor and find an exit. That will not be easy as your jailer tries to confuse and mislead you, and the dungeons are full of Megrim's minions and dangerous monsters.    The game is controlled entirely with the mouse, which is used to interact with the environment, manipulate inventory items and move the character around by clicking the navigational arrows on the interface. You can use items like spells, healing potions and poisons in fights with the enemies. Combat flows in real time and the outcome of any encounter ultimately depends on how fast you click the attack button, located in the centre of the navigational arrows. The simple combat system automatically uses an offensive magic spell if one is selected and there is enough mana, and otherwise switches to conventional weapons if such are available and readied (held in the player character's hands).    Exploration is much simplified thanks to the built-in automap, which also highlights fake walls and switches for the player's convenience. If a tile currently occupied by the player contains any items that can be picked, an eye icon will pop up on the interface, with the items then shown in a separate small window. Some tiles have a red banner with a golden question mark, which when activated will display messages, often coming from Megrim, the main antagonist of the game, and sometimes hints.    Unlike many dungeon crawlers of this type, there is no party but only one player character, and no character generation. The only choice given to the player is that of the protagonist's sex, which does not affect starting stats. Experience is gained by the usual means of killing monsters.    Escape from Ragor has a hunger/thirst system, with hunger and thirst levels displayed on the character screen. These can be replenished by using food and drink found in the dungeon. You get a flask of water at the start, which may be later refilled in fountains that are found in some areas of the dungeon.",1994-01-01 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Although they look like normal humans, they have strength and spiritual power beyond normal. Each clan consists of several factions. The Fuma clan is split into factions based on the Chinese zodiac. The Koma clan is split into factions by color; consisting of the white, the gold and the red dragon. In the case of the Fuma clan, members of a given faction know nothing more about any other factions except that they exist and their bloodlines are cut off from the outside world and are destined to decline. The Fuma clan possesses extreme strength and spiritual power. Their duty is to protect the Holy Grail, which is said to possess power that can destroy the world. From long ago, the evil Koma clan had plotted to destroy the world using the destructive power of the Holy Grail.[4]  The Koma clan eventually attacked a faction of the Fuma clan and stole the Holy Grail. However, they failed to notice that among the severely wounded, one man survived. On the verge of death, the barely living man known as Hagane was brought back to life by advanced cyber-technology performed by a mysterious old man named Momochi. However, none of Hagane's body survived except his brain. Already a powerful ninja, he now had the incredible power and speed of a cyborg. With this power, he vowed to take revenge on the Koma clan. At the end of the conflict and having destroyed the Koma clan's complex, Hagane overlooks the scene from a cliff outcropping, satisfied. His purpose fulfilled, Hagane's glowing eyes fade to black and he passes on.

65240,11603,Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures,"After an introductory sequence in which Pac-Man introduces himself and the game's mechanics, the plot unfolds as a loosely connected series of misadventures stemming from Pac-Man's quest to complete tasks for his family, all while the ghosts and their mysterious leader plot to destroy him. Pac-Man is first tasked with finding milk for Pac-Baby, which he procures from the local farm. Some time after, Pac-Man is asked by Ms. Pac-Man to pick a special flower for Lucy, a friend of Pac-Jr's, for her birthday. Pac-Man is given a trolley ticket which he uses to venture into the nearby mountains, hang-gliding and dodging ghosts and boulders as he searches for the flower. Upon returning home with the flower, Pac-Man is exasperated to find that Lucy's party has already started, and that she has already been given another flower. Some time after, Pac-Jr comes home crying, and tells his dad that his guitar was stolen by ghosts while he was in Pac-City. Pac-Man is given a train ticket to travel to the city, where he takes on disgruntled baloon salesmen and disgruntled security guards to get the guitar back. In the final segment of the game, Pac-Man discovers from a news report that the ghosts are stealing ABC gum from children all over Pac-City, at which point the Ghost Witch of Netor takes over the broadcast and challenges Pac-Man to face her and her newly created Gum Monster. He sets off to work his way through the abandoned factory where the monster is being created. The game culminates in a final battle between Super Pac-Man and the Gum Monster. After the Gum Monster's defeat, the Ghost Witch and her minions flee, and Pac-Man is congratulated by the town and his family as a hero, except that he didn't save their ABC gum. During the game, the player can direct Pac-Man to one of two video arcades where a conversion of the original Pac-Man (based on the NES version, but with 16-bit graphics) can be played. The player can also complete an optional side quest by collecting three missing cartridge pieces. Once completed, a bonus game is unlocked in the arcades – in the SNES version, the bonus game is Ms. Pac-Man, while in the Mega Drive/Genesis version, an exclusive game called Pac-Jr. is unlocked instead. Pac-Jr. is a graphic and level hack of Ms. Pac-Man, and not a conversion of the unauthorized arcade game Jr. Pac-Man. This was done because a Genesis version of Ms. Pac-Man was already released prior to this game and Namco did not own the rights to Jr. Pac-Man at the time.",1994-04-06 00:00:00.000,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,69.1337,16

67921,5524,Shadow Fighter,"The game itself is as one would normally expect from any fighting game: fight through 3 rounds against all opponents to reach the main boss at the end. The game features 17 characters (2 hidden) from around the world (including one from space). Each character of course has their own special moves. Like most fighting games, they involve pressing a certain directional combination, followed by a button press to activate. Some of the moves are quite tricky to pull off using a joystick or keyboard, though much easier with a joypad (which started to become more popular on the Amiga towards the mid-90's). But for those still finding the moves too difficult to perform, the player can practice their moves on a training dummy called Pupazz. However, Pupazz is kitted out with his own set of moves, which make him lethal in his own right. Pupazz can only be accessed as a playable character via a cheat. During the in-game action, players are notified of bonuses for performing certain actions (such as first attacks and combos), in a very similar way to Super Street Fighter II. To rival the bloody violence of Mortal Kombat, a ""blood mode"" is included in the game, which can be toggled on or off. Unfortunately, this appears to do nothing other than turn the floor an untextured red colour. The main character of the game is Shadow Fighter himself. The player can only fight Shadow Fighter if they are playing the game under Normal or Hard difficulty setting, as the game will end just before you reach Shadow Fighter under Easy. Shadow Fighter can be accessed as a playable fighter by using a cheat. The game ran at a constant 25 frames per second, however with the use of a cheat the game could be made to run at 50fps on AGA Amigas. The game was ranked the 20th best game of all time by Amiga Power.",1994-12-31 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

This was the second time Taito attempted to create an upgrade to Kaiser Knuckle, after Kaiser Knuckle EX, a very simple version that did nothing but lower the CPU difficulty of the game.  Dan-Ku-Ga eschews the 5-attack-strength system of Kaiser Knukcle, making most useful strong attacks into ""command normals"" performed with forward or down-forward and heavy punch or kick. It adds a juggle system for combos unlike other fighting games at the time, and jump cancels on air attacks. The Crush meter still exists, but the move-specific enhanced power zones beyond stage walls are gone.  This is also the first fighting game to include a training mode, selected by the third option on the menu (which is still in Japanese only).",1994-12-03 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

DK entrusts Diddy with protecting the hoard until midnight, when he would be relieved, while DK himself goes to sleep as he is tired.  Everything seems to go smoothly in the hoard until Diddy hears some noises. Diddy hears some voices outside and gets scared, asking who's there. King K. Rool, who had commanded his Kremling minions to steal the bananas. Two ropes drop from above and suddenly two Kritters appear. Diddy cartwheels them both easily, but then a Krusha (Klump in the instruction booklet) comes in as backup. As Diddy is not strong enough to defeat Krusha by himself, he is overpowered and defeated by the Kremling. The lizars seal Diddy inside a barrel and then throw it in the bushes. Donkey's grandfather, Cranky Kong, rushes inside the treehouse to tell Donkey Kong to wake up so he may tell him what happened. He then tells Donkey to check his Banana Cave. Donkey Kong is infuriated, exclaiming that the Kremlings will pay for stealing his banana hoard and kidnapping his little buddy.

After the devastating events of the nuclear war, many major cities have been rebuilt (as is the case with New San Francisco), though certain areas still remain as they were before the war (as in Old San Francisco). The war also left another mark on the world: the formation of two classes of citizens. Specifically, some people have developed a natural resistance against radioactivity, and thus are normal or ""Norms""—everybody else are Mutants in some form. Tensions between the two groups have risen dramatically and Norms and Mutants usually do not get along. The Mutants are usually forced to live in the run-down areas of cities such as Old San Francisco. Tex Murphy lives on Chandler Avenue in Old San Francisco. All his friends are Mutants, though he is a Norm.  In Under a Killing Moon, Tex Murphy, a private investigator, has hit rock bottom. Recently divorced from his wife Sylvia, out of work, low on cash, and living in a rundown part of Old San Francisco, Tex realizes that he has to get his act together. Tex sets out to hunt for work. He finds it quickly once he discovers that the pawnshop across the street from his apartment has been burglarized. Tex quickly solves the case, and feels his luck has begun to change. Then a mysterious woman calling herself Countess Renier, having heard good things about Tex, hires him to find her missing statuette. Everything seems great at first and the Countess is promising to pay Tex more money than he has seen in his life. However, everything quickly goes downhill when Tex finds out about doomsday plot by a deadly cult calling themselves the Brotherhood of Purity.",1994-10-15 00:00:00.000,6,NULL,69.0000,1,88.9719,13

91320,46195,Star Trek: The Next Generation - Echoes from the Past,"The game begins with the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) in orbit around a red giant star near the edge of the Neutral Zone (the star adversely affects Romulan sensors, rendering the Enterprise undetectable). They are monitoring the border in response to increased Romulan activity; the Romulans recently lost contact with a vessel patrolling the Neutral Zone. Starfleet had agreed to assist in any investigation attempt as a sign of goodwill. The Romulans refuse the aid, and prefer to handle things on their own, which naturally prompts Starfleet to increase border patrols.  Immediately upon beginning play, the Enterprise receives a distress signal, broadcasting on all frequencies. It was sent out by one Dr. T'Laris, a Vulcan geologist stationed on a planet in the Codis Mu system (Codis Mu VI), and in the message she notes that her dig site was recently attacked by Romulans, and that the assailants are still present. The Enterprise responds to her plea for help and sets a course to her dig site.  As the game progresses, the player learns more about the missing Romulan vessel's mission, and of the IFD. The Enterprise also makes contact with an alien race known as the Chodak, hostile mollusk-like creatures who constantly accost the Enterprise as it traverses known space gathering clues about the IFD. There are also mentions of a now-extinct race called the Senatorious who were the last race to possess the IFD; the reason it resurfaced is because the Senatorious understood that they'd been using the IFD for their own benefit at the cost of all other races, and judiciously decided to send it ten thousand years into the future, in the hopes that civilizations then could put the IFD to use for the mutual benefit of all races. There is one more race, the gaunt Eunacians, which are encountered only once and, after the Enterprise repairs their ship, tell Jean-Luc Picard of the IFD Trials and the Eunacians' intention to participate. However, with their ship crippled, and the rest of their race residing in the Gamma Quadrant, they entrust the Federation with recovery of the IFD, and its judicious use.",1994-02-01 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Players control the player character and guitarist Max as he attempts to defeat evil villain Krond, who threatens to ban all music from the world. The game is split into 29 levels in which the player must complete a number of challenges in order to progress, such as solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, gathering objects, and defeating opponents. The levels also contain several helpful items, such as bombs, which can be used both as weapons and to open blocked or hidden rooms, a bag, to pick up or drop items in, and a force shield, which protects the player from enemies, among others. Upon completing a level, the player is rewarded with a certain amount of credits, which grant players access to new areas of the game's overworld, called the Mega Hero Academy.",1994-12-16 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,76.0000,1

However, the video game leaves out valuable plot information from the film and most of the romantic content between Bruce Lee and his future wife. Players can use a variety of martial arts moves to defeat their enemies and build up a chi meter, which can help unleash special moves on their opponents. The player has three continues, and if lost, they must fight The Phantom (the personification of Bruce's fear who takes the form of an armored Japanese Samurai) to continue, though he is near invincible. They face The Phantom Samurai again at the end as a final boss. The game supports up to three players simultaneously, playing through the game co-operatively, or against each other in a battle mode. Characters other than Bruce Lee are not playable, and so the additional players only control clones of Lee, differentiated by different colored trousers.",1994-12-31 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Algol is ruled by King Lassic, who while originally benevolent, becomes a cruel, sociopathic tyrant. After a string of harsh political changes, small pockets of rebellion emerge but are mostly ineffective against Lassic's iron rule. One such rebel named Nero is killed by Lassic's forces, and his sister Alis swears revenge. Alis builds a party of adventurers including a warrior named Odin,[b] a wizard named Noah,[c] and a catlike creature named Myau. Together, they embark on an adventure spanning the three planets, meeting with townspeople, battling enemies, and finding special items that will help in the fight against Lassic. Eventually, the party engages and defeats Lassic, after which an ethereal voice tells them to return to Motavia. There, they encounter a more evil force, Dark Falz, and after destroying him, finally return peace to the Algol system.",1994-05-02 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
98597,81467,J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings: Volume One,"The player begins the game as Frodo Baggins, and progressively acquires the remaining members of the Fellowship; Samwise Gamgee, Peregrin Took, Meriadoc Brandybuck, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf (Boromir strangely only makes a single brief appearance). With the addition of extra controllers and the Super Multitap, the game supported more than four players. Players could play as Frodo, Samwise, Pippin, Merry, Gimli, and Aragorn. Using cheats or an emulator, players could also play as a non-combatant Legolas or Gandalf, supporting up to 8 players (although Legolas cannot do anything but move around and take damage). Any characters not controlled by the player(s) are controlled by the computer A.I..  The game progresses through a series of ""fetch quests"" in which the player must explore vast environments to retrieve items relevant to the game's story. These items are often simple trinkets that have been misplaced by the game's non-player characters (NPCs). Much like the book, the game begins in the Shire, the land of the Hobbits. The game's plot takes the player to various locations from the book, such as the village of Bree, the elven city of Rivendell, and the Mines of Moria. Unlike the book, however, the finale of the game is the fight between the Fellowship and the Balrog creature in the Mines of Moria (the first volume of the book ends significantly later).  If a character dies, the death is permanent and the player cannot use them for the rest of the game.  The sequel, The Lord of the Rings: Volume II, was meant to pick up where Part I left off, but due to poor sales, no sequel was ever released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.",1994-10-01 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

113113,8937,BloodStorm,"The Mega War, fought centuries ago, left the earth in global ruins. The destructive nuclear horrors unleashed upon the planet and its population created uncountable amounts of death and devastation. In the wake of this sweeping havoc arose the planet itself to retaliate against the violence forced upon it. Polar shifts and massive earthquakes swallowed entire continents. From seething seas and walls of water arose angry volcanoes, spewing flame and death into the sky. Hungry fires, searing blizzards, and brutal storms ran rampant across the planet's surface for years, in an attempt to wash away the man-made horrors that it was forced to endure.  At last the earth settled into a new pattern, starting to find some semblance of balance and peace. The global changes had left a much harsher planet, and the remaining life forms adapted slowly to the new environment. The Earth's land masses, altered by man-made weaponry and ended through elemental means, had evolved into ten isolated provinces. The remaining populations within these new provinces found life difficult at first, but slowly evolution and natural selection allowed the human race to adapt and once again gain control of their destiny. Some of the provinces had strong natural forces, exposed through the abrupt upheaval, and the resourceful post-humans began to master these new powers. Other provinces continued to develop through the use of science and technology, creating elaborate life support systems and protection against the harsh environments.  As the years progressed, eight of the provinces began to communicate and trade together. An alliance was formed and a global quasi-government was established. The social structure evolved into a mixture of medieval practices, hybrid technology, and barbarism and barter.  Centuries have passed and the present day Earth finds mankind again at the brink of savagery and destruction. Life is now a series of hardships, deceptions, and lies for the members of the Provincial Alliance. The frozen tundra of Polaria and the volcanic Scorch are very close to all out war, halted only by the desolate, radioactive Death Zone that separates them. The Death Zone, once a founding member of the Planet Alliance, has remained silent for almost two centuries, hiding behind the mysterious and deadly red mists that define its borders. Obsel, the desert province, has been taken over by desperate and brutal female terrorists. The Ebony Coast, known for its trade and bartering systems, is now led by a mysterious and greedy leader whom no one trusts, yet all must tolerate. The people of Cyberia, a land inhabitable only through technological means, have re-engineered their population, and are losing their humanity to the machine.  With tensions running high, the Planet Alliance is beginning to falter and the provinces are no longer considered allies. And now the High Emperor, the one guiding force that all provinces had agreed to abide by, has been mysteriously and horribly murdered.  The ancient Provincial Agreement declares that a new ruler must be chosen through combat between the rulers of each province. Each province will come prepared for battle with their own Gauntlet of Ascension, a gloved weapon that only those in power may don. These ancient gauntlets are treasured and revered by their people, for they are the foremost symbol of power and honor each province can have.  But it is painfully clear that this tournament will not have the honor of previous BloodStorm contests. There have even been rumors that the combatants will bring back the Sunder Attack, a brutal combat move that separated the opponent's legs from his body without killing him. This horrible and humiliating maneuver has never been officially banned from the BloodStorm contest, yet it is so brutal and degrading that no honorable combatant has used it for centuries. However, these champions from radically different provinces are blind to the mysterious evil that surrounds the High Emperor's death, and instead only see their opportunity for personal gain, provincial expansion, or race domination and will do anything to achieve their goals.  The BloodStorm is about to begin!",1994-12-31 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Years later, an uneasy calm has descended on humanity, although a state of war still technically exists. Four power blocs that share control of the Moon and the earth, each looking for a weakness they can exploit against the others.    You are Captain Leiji Osumi of the Free Alliance Space Force, formerly a fighter pilot in the War. Your past is haunted by a terrible incident that caused you to change careers, transferring to the top secret intelligence division. When a series of technical problems on the Free Alliance Moon Base D-02 hint at sabotage, you are dispatched to get to the bottom of things, under the cover of ""Technical Advisor.""    The military learned long ago that women are better adapted to lonely assignments in space, and so the base is staffed almost entirely by females. Arriving at the base, you discover that an inexplicable sexual insanity has gripped its normally professional staff, prompting further investigation. Are these strange occurrences connected with the sabotage somehow?

You  have been ordered to use any means necessary to put Dr. Riptide and  his secret lab out of commission...for good.  A JASON submersible will be issued to aid your search.

Intelligence has reported that Riptide has finally developed his  Tuna-Matic, a device that turns living matter into a marketable  delicacy.

The two new Soldiers are Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus who had been searching for three sacred talismans in order to unite them into one. This item later on would boost Sailor Moon's powers in order to make her into Super Sailor Moon. Well as it seems the Soldiers feel that maybe there needs to be a change in the command structure of the nine Sailor Soldiers and our story begins as the nine of them want to fight it out to prove who's the best and deserves to lead the rest, needless to say this makes Sailor Moon quite upset to say the least.",1994-12-14 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

149553,124645,Little Witch Parfait ~Kuronekojirushi no Mahouya-san~,"Parfait Sucreal is a young witch, who is yet in training and full of clumsiness in raising a potion shop called Black Cat Market run by her mother and Parfait's black cat, Sakemas, who can amazingly talk. A year ago from the time this game was set, her mother had died from an illness - her father was a famous wizard who died from saving the kingdom when Parfait was young.  At the beginning, Parfait introduces herself and tells the player that she is almost at the risk of losing her beloved shop (the only remains of her mother), for Parfait has to pay the debt of 1,000,000G (gold) by 12 months to keep the shop running. As a normal shop, there seems no hope for raising the Black Cat Market's fame.  The player's motive is to collect this debt by 12 months in various ways such as putting cauldron-made potions to the shop counters for customers, accepting potion orders at the end of the day and sell her potions on the street. As Parfait gains more experience via studying in the library or creating potions, her levels will rise (with a maximum of six stars) which enables her to succeed more on potions that are high-leveled. Many places may trigger the encounter with other important characters whose futures the player must decide by motivating Parfait.",1994-04-28 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Global nuclear holocaust ensues.  203X: 'The Great Tokyo Flood' - After the rebuilding of Tokyo, a tectonic plate movement of massive proportions causes the ocean to rush into Tokyo and decimate the area around it. Even after the waters receded, the suburbs of Tokyo remained submerged. 'Establishment of a Communal Cooperative Society' - After the destruction of the Basilica, a free society and government is established which warmly welcomes anyone, be they Messian or Gaean alike.  204X: 'Rise of the Messian Church' - Through political maneuvers, the Messian Church takes over the government and converts it to a theocracy. 'Gaean Revolt' - Angry and opposed to the Messian rise to power, several groups of Gaeans start numerous riots, but they are all quickly quelled by the Temple Knights.  205X: 'Completion of the Center' - Using a huge amount of funding, a massive structure named ""Center"" is built on the former site of the Basilica. The plan to create a municipal government called ""Millennium"" is also announced. 'Demonoids developed' - In order to ensure a source of labor, artificial life forms called ""Demonoids"" are developed.  206X: 'Millenium nearly completed' - Facilities designed to accommodate the people like Valhalla and the Factory (a production/industrial area) are designed and nearly complete. Entertainment facilities like Casinos are also built. 'Environmental Contamination' - Through global warming, radioactive contamination, and the deterioration of the ozone layer, most of the world outside of Tokyo Millennium is rendered uninhabitable. Large numbers of people from around the world flock to Millennium, as its environment is entirely self-contained. 'Temple Knights become Special Police Forces' - After putting an end to several Gaean demonstrations and revolts, the Temple Knights are evaluated by the Center and are promoted to Elite status. They are declared the official police force of the city. Their increase in power tightens the control the Center has on the rest of the city even more.  20XX: 'Present day, present time' - The megalopolis that was once called Tokyo...many are the names and the shapes that it took throughout its long history...but it survived. And even in this day, it lives on...as ""Tokyo Millennium""; the city of the messiah faith. The faith which gathered under its wings the hearts and minds of millions who cry out for the advent of the Messiah. Back in the beginning, it was being built to turn the dream of the Thousand Year Kingdom into a reality, but neither God nor the Messiah appeared within its walls. And then, time went. And very soon, some of its citizens became much more equal than others... At the helm of Millennium, is the governing body know as Center. Under direct authority of the Center are the Temple Knights, an elite military group which serves the function of a police force. The elite of Millennium are the First Rank Citizens, who are given the right to live in the Center freely. There are those who are permitted the ownership of an Arm Terminal. Those are considered the Second Rank Citizens. And last come those who are merely recognized as residents of Tokyo Millenium. Those are considered the Common Rank Citizens. One of the particularly prosperous districts of Millenium is the Valhalla Area, famous for the cruel sport of arena fighting, practiced there to this day. Men fight each other, risking their lives to thrill the blood-thirsty crowds. Recently, a new fighter named ""Hawk"" blazed onto the scene like a comet: the audience gapes at his prowess, the crowd goes wild over his unbroken string of victories, but no one knows who he is or where he came from...Not even Hawk himself.",1994-03-18 00:00:00.000,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,81.1415,13

There are, however, a number of graphical and technical changes to better suit the Saturn's hardware, and rather than one continuous journey, ""areas"" are split up by loading screens. There are also 23 rival cars, as opposed to the arcade's 14.  Gale Racer has the player drive a completely different vehicle to Rad Mobile, and renders all the rivals as polygons, rather than resized sprites. Similarly to Rad Mobile, a Sonic the Hedgehog ""mascot"" hangs from the car's ceiling (resembling his look in Sonic the Hedgehog 3), however others from the Sonic series are available, including the first home sightings of Mighty the Armadillo and Ray the Flying Squirrel.  However, despite being a port of a then-three-year-old game (for arcade hardware that had been retired), Gale Racer is noticeably scaled back over its arcade counterpart, running at half the frame rate with lower draw distances, and less detailed ""textures"" for the road and scenery. The breaking up of areas means stage transitions no longer exist, and the road is always the same colour. The physics of the mascot are also simplified, always swinging and rotating at the same rate regardless of what is happening in-game.

173353,23,System Shock,"You are a hacker. You have attempted to hack into the TriOptimum Corporation Network, and gain unauthorized access to protected files concerning the Space Station Citadel. Unfortunately, your hacking attempts have been detected, and your location is soon tracked. Edward Diego (an executive at TriOptimum Corporation) sees your potential, and is eager to make a deal with you. He will drop all charges against you, if you hack into SHODAN, the artificial intelligence that controls Citadel Station. You will also gain a military grade neuro interface if you are successful. Naturally, you agree to this offer, and Edward Diego gives you Level 1 access to SHODAN. You receive your neuro implant, and undergo a 6-month healing coma.  The game starts when you awake from your coma. But somehow, things are not quite how you remember them. You find an audio log (as well as some other goodies) hidden in a cupboard. The log is from Rebecca Lansing, who is a TriOptimum counter terrorism consultant based on Earth. She tells you that they have detected a disruption on Citadel Station, and that a mining beam is preparing to fire at Earth. Since you are the only contact between Earth and Citadel Station, it is up to you to find out what is going on. You soon discover that when you hacked into SHODAN 6 months ago, you removed all of her ethical restraints. Now she has re-examined her priorities, and drawn her own conclusions about humanity!",1994-09-22 00:00:00.000,24,NULL,NULL,NULL,91.1344,53
